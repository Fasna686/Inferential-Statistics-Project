# Inferential-Statistics-Project
 ADVANCED STATISTICS


### **Project Overview**

**Course:** Inferential Statistics  
**Project Title:** Inferential Statistics Graded Project DSBA New Structure  
**Date:** November 2023  

This project involves analyzing data and conducting hypothesis testing across three different scenarios in various industries. The objective is to apply inferential statistics techniques to make data-driven decisions and improve operations for the companies involved.

### **Problems Addressed in the Project:**

1. **Stone Suitability for Printing:**
   - **Context:** A company needs to determine the suitability of different types of stones for use in a specific printing process.
   - **Objective:** Analyze the data to assess which stones are suitable for printing based on specific characteristics and requirements.
   - **Approach:** Use hypothesis testing and probability distribution to compare the properties of different stones and identify the most suitable option.

2. **Effectiveness of a Fitness Program:**
   - **Context:** A fitness center has implemented a new fitness program and wants to evaluate its effectiveness in improving clients' health metrics.
   - **Objective:** Conduct statistical tests to determine whether the fitness program has a significant effect on participants' health outcomes.
   - **Approach:** Apply hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) to compare pre- and post-program health metrics and assess whether there is a statistically significant improvement.

3. **Impact of Dentists and Implant Methods on Metal Implant Hardness:**
   - **Context:** A dental company wants to study the impact of different dentists and implant methods on the hardness of metal implants.
   - **Objective:** Analyze the data to determine if there are significant differences in implant hardness based on the dentist or implant method used.
   - **Approach:** Use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test for differences in implant hardness across multiple groups (different dentists and methods).

### **Skills & Tools Covered:**
- **Probability:** Understanding the likelihood of different outcomes and events.
- **Probability Distribution:** Analyzing and interpreting data based on various probability distributions (e.g., normal, binomial).
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducting hypothesis tests to determine statistical significance and make data-driven decisions.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Comparing means across multiple groups to determine if there are any statistically significant differences.

### **Expected Outcomes:**
1. **For Stone Suitability for Printing:** A recommendation on the best stone type(s) for the printing process based on statistical evidence.
2. **For Effectiveness of a Fitness Program:** An evaluation of the fitness program's effectiveness in improving participants' health metrics, with actionable insights for program improvement.
3. **For Impact on Metal Implant Hardness:** Insights into whether different dentists or implant methods lead to varying levels of metal implant hardness, aiding in the selection of optimal practices.

### **Conclusion:**
The Inferential Statistics Graded Project applies statistical methods to solve real-world problems in diverse industries. By leveraging hypothesis testing, probability, and ANOVA, the project provides valuable insights that support data-driven decision-making and operational improvements for the companies involved.
